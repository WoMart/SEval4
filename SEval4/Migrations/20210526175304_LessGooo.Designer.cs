You have also informed your most important customer, and he has, with the usual protests, accepted your vacation. You have just poured a glass of mulled wine when the phone rings. You curse your forgetfulness about leaving the phone on before answering. A very apologetic woman presents herself as a newly employed technician of your customer. She tells you that she is very sorry for calling you, but because she is going to upgrade the customer's backup system she needs to know where the files you have worked on can be found. She also wants to know which computer they are located in and what folder, as well as what user-name you have, in order to guarantee that they will be backed up in the new system. You give her this information, and she thanks you and wishes you a Merry Christmas. An hour later she calls again, almost ready to cry. Something has gone wrong with your backup, she suspects, as it has been locked in the system, and she is the only one left over Christmas. It also seems that only your files are causing trouble. She asks if you would consider coming into the customer's office, checking this, something you refuse. She then wonders if you can give her your login information to enable her to quickly check that the files have not been destroyed so that you can both celebrate Christmas in peace.

You have been extra careful ensuring that your tasks at work have been divided among colleagues, so that everyone knows who is responsible for what while you are on vacation. You have also informed your most important customer, and he has, with the usual protests, accepted your vacation. You have just poured a glass of mulled wine when the phone rings. You curse your forgetfulness about leaving the phone on before answering. A very apologetic woman presents herself as a newly employed technician of your customer. She tells you that she is very sorry for calling you, but because she is going to upgrade the customer's backup system she needs to know where the files you have worked on can be found. She also wants to know which computer they are located in and what folder, as well as what user-name you have, in order to guarantee that they will be backed up in the new system. You give her this information, and she thanks you and wishes you a Merry Christmas. An hour later she calls again, almost ready to cry. Something has gone wrong with your backup, she suspects, as it has been locked in the system, and she is the only one left over Christmas. It also seems that only your files are causing trouble. She asks if you would consider coming into the customer's office, checking this, something you refuse. She then wonders if you can give her your login information to enable her to quickly check that the files have not been destroyed so that you can both celebrate Christmas in peace. Which action do you take?",
